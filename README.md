# Name
Magarita Express - a website that provides customers a convenient way to order drinks to their doorstep.

# Description
Given the limited varieties of APIs I have found online, I was able to start my project as an online margarita bar. 

Customers can easily place orders for our 3 featuring margaritas online. Wesbite not only features ingredient lists for each drinks, but also a hidden button that applies generous discounts upon clicking it.  

# Project Requirements
3 Separate Event Listeners:
- "Click" - Order Button
    function houseMargaritas()
    function orangeMargaritas()
    redMargaritas()

- "MouseDown" - Star Logo
    star1.addEventListener("mouseover",function()
    star2.addEventListener("mouseover",function()
    star3.addEventListener("mouseover",function()


- "Dblclick" - Margarita Emoji
    function hiddenDiscount()

Interactivity:
- Quantity dropdown menu 
    <br><label for="quantity">Qty:</label>
              <select>
                <option>1</option>
                <option>2</option>
                <option>3</option>
                <option>4</option>
                <option>5</option>
