# Project
Magarita Express is a website that provides customers a convenient way to order drinks online. 

# Description
During the initial brainstorm for my project, the idea of creating an online store appeals me the most. Given the limited varieties of APIs I have found online, I was able to start my project as an online margarita bar. 

Magarita Express is the name of the website. Customers can easily place orders of our 3 featuring margaritas online with
guaranteed 2 hour delivery service. Wesbite also features ingredient lists and next week's featuring margartias.
